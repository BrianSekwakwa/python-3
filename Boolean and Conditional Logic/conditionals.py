# CONDITIONAL CHECKS

# conditonal logic using "if statements" to fork paths in your program based of a certain condition

# Example

# name = input("What is your game of thrones character eg. arya stark \n")

# if name == "arya stark":
#     print("Valar Morghulis")
# elif name == "john snow":
#     print("You know nothing")
# else:
#     print("Carry on with your journey paddiwon")

# COMPARISSON OPERATORS

# == (equal to)
# != (not equal to)
# > (greater than)
# < (less than)
# >= (greater than or equal to)
# <= (less than or equal to)

# Example

# age = int(input("What is your age: "))

# if age < 18:
#     print("You are still a minor")
# elif age >= 18:
#     print("You are an adult you can now vote")

# LOGICAL OPERATORS

# and (AND - if both parties are True)
# or (OR - if one of the parties is True )
# not (NOT - if neither of the parties is True)
